â˜• The Rainy Day â€“ A Fully Built 3D CafÃ© Environment
The Rainy Day is a cinematic 3D environment I created from scratch to capture the cozy, calm vibe of a cafÃ© during a rainy afternoon. This project showcases my skills in modeling, texturing, lighting, and storytelling within a fully realized virtual space.

ðŸ”§ What I did:
Modeled all assets including furniture, props, and interior layout.

Created realistic materials (wood, glass, metal, etc.) using PBR techniques.

Designed lighting and composition to evoke a warm and inviting mood.

Built the entire scene in Blender, rendered with Cycles.

ðŸ›  Tools Used:
Blender (Cycles)

Photoshop

Render Cloud by Praxilla

ðŸŽ¨ Textures:
Textures used in this project were sourced from Poly Haven â€“ a fantastic platform offering free, high-quality, CC0 textures and HDRIs.
